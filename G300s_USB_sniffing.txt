   S == submission
  Co == Control Output to:
      :2 == Bus 2;
    :039 == Device 039;
      :0 == Endpoint 0
   s == Status?
  - Setup:
      21 == bmRequestType
      09 == bRequest
    03f5 == wValue
    0001 == wIndex
    0023 == wLength

- Event Type. This type refers to the format of the event, not URB type.
  Available types are: S - submission, C - callback, E - submission error.

- "Address" word (formerly a "pipe"). It consists of four fields, separated by
  colons: URB type and direction, Bus number, Device address, Endpoint number.
  Type and direction are encoded with two bytes in the following manner:
    Ci Co   Control input and output
    Zi Zo   Isochronous input and output
    Ii Io   Interrupt input and output
    Bi Bo   Bulk input and output

- Setup packet, if present, consists of 5 words: one of each for bmRequestType,
  bRequest, wValue, wIndex, wLength, as specified by the USB Specification 2.0.
  These words are safe to decode if Setup Tag was 's'. Otherwise, the setup
  packet was present, but not captured, and the fields contain filler.
